The exercises for the initial part of this workshop are relatively simple.
If you don't want to use an IDE (recommended) you have some other options
detailed below. You only need to set up ONE of these options.


Option 1 (recommended): Using an IDE (intelliJ recomended) and Gradle

To build the lab documentation run the following:

    ./gradlew asciidoctor (skip the initial ./ for windows)

The generated documentation should be at build/asciidoc/index.html.
This approach uses gradle which will download all the needed dependencies.


Option 2: Using a Groovy distribution with the GroovyConsole/text editor

If you don't already have a Groovy distribution, download it from here:
https://dl.bintray.com/groovy/maven/apache-groovy-binary-2.5.0-beta-2.zip
